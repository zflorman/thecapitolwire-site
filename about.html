                Why I built an AI to read Congress so you don't have to.

            <p>
                <strong>I used to be a staffer on the Hill.</strong> I remember the late nights, the cold coffee, and the sheer panic of staring at a 2,000-page bill that dropped at midnight, knowing we had to vote on it by morning.
            </p>
            <p>
                The truth is, most of what happens in Congress goes unread. Not because people don't care, but because the volume is impossible for a human to keep up with. Important provisions get buried in "technical corrections," and procedural rules are used to hide what's really going on.
            </p>
            <p>
                I realized that while we were drowning in paper, we had the technology to fix it. So, I built <strong>The Capitol Wire</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 pt-4">How it Works</h3>
            <p>
                I trained an AI specifically on legislative text. It doesn't just "summarize"—it acts like a senior legislative analyst. It scans the live feed from the Clerk's office 24/7. When a new bill or rule drops, the bot:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 marker:text-blue-600">
                <li><strong>Translates Legalese:</strong> It turns dense statutory language into plain English.</li>
                <li><strong>Flags the Tricks:</strong> It hunts for "self-executing rules" and waived points of order—the stuff leadership uses to sneak things past us.</li>
                <li><strong>Provides Receipts:</strong> This is the most important part. I don't trust AI blindly, and neither should you. That's why every claim comes with a <em>Verification Guide</em> citing the exact page number.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 pt-4">Why it's Free</h3>
            <p>
                In Washington, real-time legislative intelligence usually costs $20,000 a year and is only available to K Street lobbyists. That didn't sit right with me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I built this tool to level the playing field. Whether you're a junior staffer trying to survive your first session, a journalist covering the beat, or just a citizen who wants to know what's actually being voted on—this is for you.
            </p>
